The main idea of my project is to create a website that can give you random movies to watch based on some parameters that you enter.

I am interested in this because I like to watch movie but sometimes it is hard to find a movie that I havent watched or am interested in so something that could give you random movies was interesting to me.

I would make it so that you could create an account that you could have movies that you have watched already and it would exclude them from the list of random movies that it could give you. I might also make it so that you could give more specific parameters.

Have it give you 8 random movies that fit the parameters that you have entered then have the name of the movies be a link that will take you to a page with more information about the movie that you clicked on. that page may have links to actors wikis or place to watch the movie.

I think that the smallest in terms of code that it would still be useful is to just give you 1 random movie everytime you refreshed the page.
